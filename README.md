# Image_deduplication
A method to find near-duplicate images in an image collection.  

## Image Correlation Coefficient
The metrics, coefficient of correlation measures the degree of correlation between two images. Correlation is the method establishing the degree of probability that a linear relationship exists between two measured quantities.
### Correlation Coefficient Formula:
![formula](https://i.ibb.co/r02Cf0G/imgg.jpg)
The correlation co-efficient has value  
1. r = 1 if two images are absolute identical  
2. r = 0 if they are completely uncorrelated  
3. r = -1 if they are anti correlated.
